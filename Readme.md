        3.)os(path)<br>
        4.)PIL(image)  <br>

        3.)sample memo pdf(generated from the programme)<br>
        4.)py files<br>

  (c.)paths are used at many places hence its necessary that u should migrate inside your file(whch contains stuff listed in (b.))<br>
        1.)just open this whole file in vs code and ensure the terminal is pointing inside  the file(if not use 'cd' to migrate)<br>
        2.)above step ensure you want end up getting weird errors for wrong path(also you dont have to update imagespath individually)<br>
